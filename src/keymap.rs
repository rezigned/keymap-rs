//! # `KeyMap` Library
//!
//! This library provides a unified abstraction over key input representations from multiple backends,
//! such as [`crossterm`](https://crates.io/crates/crossterm), WebAssembly environments, and more.
//! It enables parsing, transforming, and serializing key input events to and from a common `KeyMap`
//! format, which is represented by a node tree from the `keymap_parser` crate.
//!
//! The main goal is to decouple application logic from backend-specific input handling, enabling easier
//! testing, configuration, and cross-platform support.
